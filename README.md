# ex_tac_toe
Little tic tac toe game written in Elixir to practice Pattern Matching

To play the game, just call Game.check_board({ your pieces here }) from the interactive elixir shell.

You use Atoms to play. So you call :x for an X piece, and :o for an O piece.

There is no multiplayer or AI, but there may be in the future.
